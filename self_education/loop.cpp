/*
When we know exactly how many times we want to iterate (or when we are counting), 
we can use a for loop instead of a while loop.
Incrementing for loop:
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) 
    {
        // Statements
    }
Decrementing for loop:
    for (int i = 20; i > 0; i--) 
    {
        // Statements
    }
