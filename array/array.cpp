    Arrays:
    Unlike vectors, its size cannot be changed.
    With arrays, you canâ€™t add or remove elements; you can only modify existing elements.
    Ex.:
        Creating an array:
            int favoriteNums[4];                -- all four elements will initially have the default int value of 0
            int favoriteNums[] = {7, 9, 15, 16};
